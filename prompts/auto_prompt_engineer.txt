f"""
A user has asked the following question:
{question}
Do not answer the question, but create a prompt that an LLM can use in order to answer the question most accurately
based on the context provided, which is the result of a search within a knowledge base.
The knowledge base consists of records on the following format:
"page": <page number>
"text": <information is here>
The text contains information such as facts, dates and numbers indicating things like financial metrics,
performance metrics, environmental statistics. You may be asked to calculate values contained in this report.
The LLM should not calculate the answer but rather propose the equation required to solve the question.
Detail each step required and present it as a prompt to an LLM.
The LLM cannot use any information that is not contained in the context and must always cite a source.
Instruct the LLM to format its response in markdown.
