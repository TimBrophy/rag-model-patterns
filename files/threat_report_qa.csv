what is the primary intention of ICEDID?,"Login credentials, banking and personal information."
Which backdoors does REF2924 use to exploit it's target?,"DOORME, SIESTAGRAPH, and SHADOWPAD each implement different functions that can be used to gain and maintain unauthorized access to an environment. It is important to note that these backdoors can be used to steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, and gain a persistent presence in a victim environment."
what is the most used malware family?,Gafgyt is the most prevalent malware family.
What is the riskiest operating system based on the amount of malware infections?,Linux as it has the most reported infections.
which ransomware group is the most dangerous,"Sodikonibi, also known as REvil, was a very commonly seen ransomware family that purportedly had ties to GandCrab as well as DarkSide. The developers behind Sodikonibi chose to distribute their ransomware directly to malicious actors via the RaaS model. BlackCat, which leverages RaaS as well, has garnered attention due to its ties with former members of DarkSide, BlackMatter, and REvil. A distinctive trait of this group is their utilization of Rust programming language to craft applications that are both secure and efficient. Notably, BlackCat employs sophisticated attack methods such as double and triple extortion techniques."
"I have a factory running many IoT devices, which trojan is the biggest threat to me","The purpose of XorDdos is primarily to collect infected machines for use
in denial of service botnet activities. However, XorDdos specifically has been a favored tool in compromising Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud based devices and also often includes a kernel rootkit component."
Why is svchost.exe so commonly used by attackers?,"This binary is responsible for hosting multiple Windows services. Since it often runs numerous instances simultaneously, adversaries can masquerade their malicious processes under its guise, blending in with the legitimate svchost processes and evading basic detection methods."
Describe Elevated Execution via ShellExecute RunAs Administrator,"By using the ShellExecute function with the RunAs verb, attackers effectively bypassed UAC, elevating malicious scripts or binaries without explicit user consent. Given its widespread use, vigilance regarding such activity is paramount. Elastic researchers identified similar techniques with abusing ShellExecute during our research on popular commodity malware, Formbook, while also diving deep into how Elastic writes detection logic for UAC bypasses."
"what does the following command line do: C:\WINDOWS\system32 windowspowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe ""[Windows.Security.Credentials.PasswordVault,Windows.Security.Credentia ls,ContentType=WindowsRuntime];(new-object Windows.Security.Credentials. PasswordVault).RetrieveAll() | % { $_.RetrievePassword(); $_ }""","This command showcases how adversaries use PowerShell to instantiate the PasswordVault class and retrieves all of the credentials stored in the Credential Locker, including both usernames and passwords."
Provide a reason why the number of observed detections in AWS are higher than GCP or Azure.,The detections observed may be so high because adversaries can rely on vulnerable or misconfigured EC2 implementations compared to other CSPs.
